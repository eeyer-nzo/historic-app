Balestier Plain was a vast open space in the early 1900s.The playing fields bounded by Balestier Road from Tessensohn Road to Moulmein Road were known as Balestier Plain. It was associated to eight sports clubs in its vicinity - the Ceylon Sports Club (CSC), the Ceylon Tamils' Association (CTA), the Singapore Indian Association (IA), the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the Singapore Chinese Recreation Club (SCRC), the Singapore Khalsa Association (SKA), the Singapore Malay Football Clubs (MFC) and Kamala Club (KC), or collectively known as the Balestier Plain Clubs. Thus, Balestier Plain had then transformed into an area representing the three major races of sports in Singapore. When the Japanese invaded Singapore during World War II, the British stored drums of petrol in the club buildings and bombed these places in defence. After Singapore's defeat, the Japanese built their military barracks on the site and the field of Balestier Plain was later used to grow vegetable garden full of food-producing plants to cope with the scarcity of food. What was left of the field was badly damaged and could no longer be used for sport activities. Balestier Plain did not stay this way for long. It was given back to the citizens in the year 1947 after the liberation of Singapore and work of levelling the plain was completed on August the following year. Once that was completed, government surveyors were deployed to fix up a formation level to ensure that the whole field was one level plain before final touches from the respective clubs made to their own plots of land.
